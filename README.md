# InfHost

**"infhost"** is a bash-based command line utility designed to efficiently gather detailed information about the current host on Unix systems. It's ideal to track main workstations information in an Active Directory experimental environment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository into your machine or simply extract the content of the shell binary.
2. Assign execution permissions over the binary and run.
3. In case you want the tool recognized by the system from anywhere you can export it to the PATH variable by folling the next steps:
    - Move the binary to a path such as *"/usr/local/bin"*
    - Go to your *.bashrc/.zshrc* (depending of your system shell) and add this line:
      
      ```bash
      export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
      ```
